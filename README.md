# MNMkrWiFi1010RGBLEDLib

Arduino library to use either built in RGB LED on Mkr WiFi 1010 or an external RGB LED

Defines a RGB macro to create a colour value and defines an enum to describe a number of preset colours for ease of use and RGBType to hold value

Supports a flash option that in turn uses the MNTimer library
